### Fixing Data

#### What is XML and why should humanists care?
* structure of a written work conveys meaning as much as linguistic content
* ordered & hierarchical
* XML is structures model similar to a tree 
* root, contains everything else
* nodes, components & subcomponents of root
* humanities scholars use for two reasons:
1 human documents tend to translate well into XML b/c of ordered hierarchies
2 computers can operate quickly and efficiently on trees 
* first step in digital humanities: document analysis
* consider the documents you intend to use: identify useful hierarchical structure within them
* next, mark up/encode, make that hierarchy accessible to the computer 
* also called tagging in XML context
* otherwise computer won't know where to start and end its analysis/work
* digital humanities uses descriptive markup - describes what a textual subcomponent is
* presentational markup, describes what text looks like
* procedural markup, instructs computer on what to do to text 
* descriptive enables multipurpose use (only having to do markup once) where presentational and procedural do not
* one pitfall of XML is it doesn't cope well with multiple/simultaneous/overlapping hierarchies

* XML models using elements: consist of start tag, content and end tag
* tags written into text of XML documents, then read by XML-aware software
* end users typically don't see brackets
* four types of content:
1 element content
2 text content
3 mixed content
4 empty element
