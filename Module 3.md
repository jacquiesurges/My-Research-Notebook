### Fixing Data

#### What is XML and why should humanists care?
* structure of a written work conveys meaning as much as linguistic content
* ordered & hierarchical
* XML is structures model similar to a tree 
* root, contains everything else
* nodes, components & subcomponents of root
* humanities scholars use for two reasons:
* 1) human documents tend to translate well into XML b/c of ordered hierarchies
* 2) computers can operate quickly and efficiently on trees
