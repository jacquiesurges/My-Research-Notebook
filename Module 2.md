###Ian Milligan presentation:

* pitfalls of digitized historical data: requires institutional support/$, so often replicates holdings of elite, Western institutions
* different ways to get data: The Dream Case, scraping data yourself with free software, API's, Wget

###Milligan's "Illusionary Order: Cautionary Notes for Online Newspapers"

* dangers of digitized newspapers, can skew research
* "using Pages of the Past uncritically for historical research is akin to using a volume of theÂ Canadian Historical Review with 10% or so of the pages ripped out"
* optical character recognition (OCR) - conversion of scanned words to readable text, leaves potential to miss words from scanned microfilm
* can miss pieces of articles continued from previous pages by chance because of placement of headline/keywords
* Toronto Star & Globe and Mail digitized by private companies - why is this potentially problematic?
* How do the tools we're using shape our research?

##Exercise 1: The Dream Case

* data sorted into pre-existing database, compilers should have laid out their methodologies & decision making process
* Searched Commonwealth War Graves Commission database for war dead> surname: Racine
* Results saved in downloads as excel spreadsheet, look for CasualtySearch
