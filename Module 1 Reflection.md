##Reflection on Module 1

So, I realize I'm a bit late in the game to only be completing Module 1, but here we are. I admittedly am having a really tough time with this course so far, but am finding that every time I get stuck all I need to do is ask for clarification and there's always someone else in the course who knows what's up. If nothing else, so far I've really learned that collaboration is key. 

I mentioned this in my introductory/markdown practice post, but it's a novel concept to me as a journalism student to actually collaborate on work like this.

My biggest challenge so far has actually been comprehending the purpose behind what we're working on. Once I asked for help & further explanation it's all starting to make a bit more sense to me. Technical skills aside, I've found the work for this course a lot easier to get through when I actually understand why I'm doing it. Otherwise it all feels a bit overwhelming. 

My favourite part of the course so far has actually been our exposure to markdown syntax. It's neat to me that plain text converts so beautifully into a finished product with simple text commands. The most exposure I've had to web publishing has been through Wordpress, so even simple achievements in md feel good to me. 

The biggest challenge has been our work in the command line. It took me way too long to actually figure out how to access Terminal on my computer, let alone figure out the commands. But at least I know that's something to work on.

Halfway through Module 2 as of today, so we'll see what the next challenge is!
